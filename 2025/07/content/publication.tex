  \item Published research on handling imbalanced satellite Internet datasets using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).
  \item Evaluated the impact of SMOTE on Logistic Regression and Random Forest, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  \item Analyzed a large-scale diabetes dataset of over 100,000 records to demonstrate Random Forest’s robustness and SMOTE’s effects.
