Code Summarizer AI-Model}{February 2025 - May 2025}
  {\begin{itemize}
    \item Designing and developing an Eclipse plugin that leverages transformer-based NLP models (CodeT5) to auto-generate Java method and class summaries, improving code comprehension within the IDE.
    \item Completed AST parsing and integrated code rewriting using Eclipse JDT, enabling automated comment insertion in real-time.
    \item Preprocessed 50,000+ Java methods from the CodeXGLUE dataset and implemented a functional training pipeline on Lambda Cloud for initial model experimentation.
    \item Currently optimizing model performance through pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to ensure lightweight, CPU-compatible deployment without sacrificing accuracy.
    \item Planned full evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, with final integration of an IDE GUI interface and testing across large-scale Java projects.
  \end{itemize}
